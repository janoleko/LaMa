\title{Compute the stationary distribution of a homogeneous Markov chain}
\usage{
stationary(Gamma)
}
\arguments{
\item{Gamma}{Transition probability matrix of dimension c(N,N)}
}
\value{
Stationary distribution of the Markov chain with the given transition probability matrix
}
\description{
A homogeneous, finite state Markov chain that is irreducible and aperiodic converges to a unique stationary distribution, here called \eqn{\delta}.
As it is stationary, this distribution satisfies \cr \cr
\eqn{\delta \Gamma = \delta}, subject to \eqn{\sum_{j=1}^N \delta_j = 1}, \cr \cr
where \eqn{\Gamma} is the transition probability matrix. 
This function solves the linear system of equations above.\cr
