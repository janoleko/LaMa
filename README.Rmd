A variety of **latent Markov models** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19157" target="_blank">[@mews2024build]</a>, including **hidden Markov models** (HMMs), **hidden semi-Markov models** (HSMMs), **state-space models** (SSMs) 
and **continuous-time** variants can be formulated and estimated within the same framework via directly maximising the likelihood function using the so-called **forward algorithm** <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b20790/hidden-markov-models-time-series-walter-zucchini-iain-macdonald-roland-langrock" target="_blank">[@zucchini]</a>.
Applied researchers often need custom models that standard software does not easily support. Writing tailored `R` code offers flexibility but suffers from slow estimation speeds. This `R` package solves these issues by providing easy-to-use functions (written in C++ for speed) for common tasks like the forward algorithm. These functions can be combined into custom models in a Lego-type approach, offering up to 10-20 times faster estimation via standard numerical optimisers. In its most recent iteration, `LaMa` allows for automatic differentiation with the `RTMB` package which drastically increases speed and accuracy even more.

The most important families of functions are

* the `forward` family that calculates the log-likelihood for various different models,

* the `tpm` family for calculating transition probability matrices,
  <!-- + `tpm()` for calculating a homogeneous transition probability matrix via the multinomial logistic link,  -->
  <!-- + `tpm_g()` for calculating general inhomogeneous transition probabilty matrices,  -->
  <!-- + `tpm_p()` for calculating transition matrices of periodically inhomogeneous HMMs, -->
  <!-- + `tpm_cont()` for calculating the transition probabilites of a continuous-time Markov chain, -->
  <!-- + `tpm_emb()` for calculating the embedded transition matrix of an HSMM, -->

* the `stationary` family to compute stationary and periodically stationary distributions

* as well as the `stateprobs` and `viterbi` families for local and global decoding.

## Introductory example: Homogeneous HMM

We analyse the `trex` data set contained in the package. It contains hourly step lengths of a Tyrannosaurus rex, living 66 million years ago. To these data, we fit a simple 2-state HMM with state-dependent gamma distributions for the step lengths.

```{r package}
library(LaMa)

head(trex, 3)
```
We start by defining the negative log-likelihood function. This is made really convenient by the functions `tpm()` which computes the transition probability matrix via the multinomial logit link, `stationary()` which computes the stationary distribution of the Markov chain and `forward()` which calculates the log-likelihood via the forward algorithm.

```{r nll}
nll = function(par, step){
  # parameter transformations for unconstrained optimisation
  Gamma = tpm(par[1:2]) # rowwise softmax
  delta = stationary(Gamma) # stationary distribution
  mu = exp(par[3:4]) # state-dependent means
  sigma = exp(par[5:6]) # state-dependent sds
  # calculating all state-dependent probabilities
  allprobs = matrix(1, length(step), 2)
  ind = which(!is.na(step))
  for(j in 1:2) allprobs[ind,j] = dgamma2(step[ind], mu[j], sigma[j])
  # simple forward algorithm to calculate log-likelihood
  -forward(delta, Gamma, allprobs)
}
```

To fit the model, we define the intial parameter vector and numerically optimise the above function using `nlm()`:
```{r model, warning=FALSE}
par = c(-2,-2,             # initial tpm params (logit-scale)
        log(c(0.3, 2.5)),  # initial means for step length (log-transformed)
        log(c(0.2, 1.5)))  # initial sds for step length (log-transformed)

system.time(
  mod <- nlm(nll, par, step = trex$step)
)
```
Really fast for 10.000 data points!

After tranforming the working (unconstrained) parameters to natural parameters using `tpm()` and `stationary()`, we can visualise the results:

```{r visualization}
# transform parameters to working
Gamma = tpm(mod$estimate[1:2])
delta = stationary(Gamma) # stationary HMM
mu = exp(mod$estimate[3:4])
sigma = exp(mod$estimate[5:6])

hist(trex$step, prob = TRUE, bor = "white", breaks = 40, main = "", xlab = "step length")
curve(delta[1] * dgamma2(x, mu[1], sigma[1]), add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "orange", n=500)
curve(delta[2] * dgamma2(x, mu[2], sigma[2]), add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "deepskyblue", n=500)
legend("topright", col = c("orange", "deepskyblue"), lwd = 2, bty = "n", legend = c("state 1", "state 2"))
```
