\title{Computes penalty based on quadratic form}
\usage{
penalty(re_coef, S, lambda)
}
\arguments{
\item{re_coef}{coefficient vector/ matrix or list of coefficient vectors/ matrices

Each list entry corresponds to a different smooth/ random effect with its own associated penalty matrix in \code{S}.
When several smooths/ random effects of the same kind are present, it is convenient to pass them as a matrix, where each row corresponds to one smooth/ random effect. 
This way all rows can use the same penalty matrix.}

\item{S}{fixed penalty matrix or list of penalty matrices matching the structure of \code{re_coef} and also the dimension of the individuals smooths/ random effects}

\item{lambda}{penalty strength parameter vector that has a length corresponding to the \strong{total number} of random effects/ spline coefficients in \code{re_coef}

E.g. if \code{re_coef} contains one vector and one matrix with 4 rows, then \code{lambda} needs to be of length 5.}
}
\value{
returns the penalty value and reports to \code{\link{qreml}}.
}
\description{
This function computes quadratic penalties of the form
\deqn{0.5 \sum_{i} \lambda_i b_i^T S_i b_i,}
with smoothing parameters \eqn{\lambda_i}, coefficient vectors \eqn{b_i}, and fixed penalty matrices \eqn{S_i}.

It is intended to be used inside the \strong{penalised negative log-likelihood function} when fitting models with penalised splines or simple random effects via \strong{quasi restricted maximum likelihood} (qREML) with the \code{\link{qreml}} function.
For \code{\link{qreml}} to work, the likelihood function needs to be compatible with the \code{RTMB} R package to enable automatic differentiation.
}
\details{
\strong{Caution:} The formatting of \code{re_coef} needs to match the structure of the parameter list in your penalised negative log-likelihood function, 
i.e. you cannot have two random effect vectors of different names (different list elements in the parameter list), combine them into a matrix inside your likelihood and pass the matrix to \code{penalty}.
If these are seperate random effects, each with its own name, they need to be passed as a list to \code{penalty}. Moreover, the ordering of \code{re_coef} needs to match the character vector \code{random} specified in \code{\link{qreml}}.

\examples{
# Example with a single random effect
re = rep(0, 5)
S = diag(5)
lambda = 1
penalty(re, S, lambda)

# Example with two random effects, 
# where one element contains two random effects of similar structure
re = list(matrix(0, 2, 5), rep(0, 4))
S = list(diag(5), diag(4))
lambda = c(1,1,2) # length = total number of random effects
penalty(re, S, lambda)
