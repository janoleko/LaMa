# LaMa - Latent Markov model toolbox 🛠️ ![](reference/figures/Logo_LaMa_surf.png)

A variety of **latent Markov models** [(Mews, Koslik, and Langrock
2025)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1471082X251355681),
including **hidden Markov models** (HMMs), **hidden semi-Markov models**
(HSMMs), **state-space models** (SSMs) and **continuous-time** variants
can be formulated and estimated within the same framework via directly
maximising the likelihood function using the so-called **forward
algorithm** [(Zucchini, MacDonald, and Langrock
2016)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b20790/hidden-markov-models-time-series-walter-zucchini-iain-macdonald-roland-langrock).
Applied researchers often need custom models that standard software does
not easily support. Writing tailored `R` code offers flexibility but
suffers from slow estimation speeds. This `R` package solves these
issues by providing easy-to-use functions (written in C++ for speed) for
common tasks like the forward algorithm. These functions can be combined
into custom models in a Lego-type approach, offering up to 10-20 times
faster estimation via standard numerical optimisers. In its most recent
iteration, `LaMa` allows for automatic differentiation with the `RTMB`
package which drastically increases speed and accuracy even more.

The most important families of functions are

- the `forward` family that calculates the log-likelihood for various
  different models,

- the `tpm` family for calculating transition probability matrices,

- the `stationary` family to compute stationary and periodically
  stationary distributions

- as well as the `stateprobs` and `viterbi` families for local and
  global decoding.

## Introductory example: Homogeneous HMM

We analyse the `trex` data set contained in the package. It contains
hourly step lengths of a Tyrannosaurus rex, living 66 million years ago.
To these data, we fit a simple 2-state HMM with state-dependent gamma
distributions for the step lengths.

``` r
library(LaMa)
#> Loading required package: RTMB

head(trex, 3)
#>   tod      step     angle state
#> 1   9 0.3252437        NA     1
#> 2  10 0.2458265  2.234562     1
#> 3  11 0.2173252 -2.262418     1
```

We start by defining the negative log-likelihood function. This is made
really convenient by the functions
[`tpm()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/tpm.md) which computes
the transition probability matrix via the multinomial logit link,
[`stationary()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/stationary.md)
which computes the stationary distribution of the Markov chain and
[`forward()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/forward.md) which
calculates the log-likelihood via the forward algorithm.

``` r
nll = function(par, step){
  # parameter transformations for unconstrained optimisation
  Gamma = tpm(par[1:2]) # rowwise softmax
  delta = stationary(Gamma) # stationary distribution
  mu = exp(par[3:4]) # state-dependent means
  sigma = exp(par[5:6]) # state-dependent sds
  # calculating all state-dependent probabilities
  allprobs = matrix(1, length(step), 2)
  ind = which(!is.na(step))
  for(j in 1:2) allprobs[ind,j] = dgamma2(step[ind], mu[j], sigma[j])
  # simple forward algorithm to calculate log-likelihood
  -forward(delta, Gamma, allprobs)
}
```

To fit the model, we define the intial parameter vector and numerically
optimise the above function using
[`nlm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/nlm.html):

``` r
par = c(-2,-2,             # initial tpm params (logit-scale)
        log(c(0.3, 2.5)),  # initial means for step length (log-transformed)
        log(c(0.2, 1.5)))  # initial sds for step length (log-transformed)

system.time(
  mod <- nlm(nll, par, step = trex$step)
)
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.364   0.012   0.379
```

Really fast for 10.000 data points!

After tranforming the working (unconstrained) parameters to natural
parameters using [`tpm()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/tpm.md)
and
[`stationary()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/stationary.md), we
can visualise the results:

``` r
# transform parameters to working
(Gamma = tpm(mod$estimate[1:2]))
#>           S1        S2
#> S1 0.8269546 0.1730454
#> S2 0.1608470 0.8391530
(delta = stationary(Gamma)) # stationary HMM
#>       S1       S2 
#> 0.481733 0.518267
(mu = exp(mod$estimate[3:4]))
#> [1] 0.3034926 2.5057053
(sigma = exp(mod$estimate[5:6]))
#> [1] 0.2015258 1.4908153

hist(trex$step, prob = TRUE, bor = "white", breaks = 40, main = "", xlab = "step length")
curve(delta[1] * dgamma2(x, mu[1], sigma[1]), add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "orange", n=500)
curve(delta[2] * dgamma2(x, mu[2], sigma[2]), add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "deepskyblue", n=500)
legend("topright", col = c("orange", "deepskyblue"), lwd = 2, bty = "n", legend = c("state 1", "state 2"))
```
