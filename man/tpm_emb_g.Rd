\title{Build all embedded transition probability matrices of an inhomogeneous HSMM}
\usage{
tpm_emb_g(Z, beta, report = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{covariate design matrix with or without intercept column, i.e. of dimension c(n, p) or c(n, p+1)

If \code{Z} has only p columns, an intercept column of ones will be added automatically.}

\item{beta}{matrix of coefficients for the off-diagonal elements of the embedded transition probability matrix

Needs to be of dimension c(N*(N-2), p+1), where the first column contains the intercepts.
p can be 0, in which case the model is homogeneous.}

\item{report}{logical, indicating whether the coefficient matrix beta should be reported from the fitted model. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
array of embedded/ conditional transition probability matrices of dimension c(N,N,n)
}
\description{
Hidden semi-Markov models are defined in terms of state durations and an \strong{embedded} transition probability matrix that contains the conditional transition probabilities given that the \strong{current state is left}. This matrix necessarily has diagonal entries all equal to zero as self-transitions are impossible.
We can allow this matrix to vary with covariates, which is the purpose of this function.

It builds all embedded/ conditional transition probability matrices based on a design and parameter matrix.
For each row of the matrix, the inverse multinomial logistic link is applied.

For a matrix of dimension c(N,N), the number of free off-diagonal elements is N*(N-2) which determines the number of rows of the parameter matrix.

Compatible with automatic differentiation by \code{RTMB}

\examples{
## parameter matrix for 3-state HSMM
beta = matrix(c(rep(0, 3), -0.2, 0.2, 0.1), nrow = 3)
# no intercept
Z = rnorm(100)
omega = tpm_emb_g(Z, beta)
# intercept
Z = cbind(1, Z)
omega = tpm_emb_g(Z, beta)
