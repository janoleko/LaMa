# Builds the transition probability matrix of an HSMM-approximating HMM

Hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are a flexible extension of HMMs,
where the state duration distribution is explicitly modelled. For direct
numerical maximum likelhood estimation, HSMMs can be represented as HMMs
on an enlarged state space (of size \\M\\) and with structured
transition probabilities.

This function computes the transition matrix to approximate a given HSMM
by an HMM with a larger state space.

## Usage

``` r
tpm_hsmm(omega, dm, Fm = NULL, sparse = TRUE, eps = 1e-10)
```

## Arguments

- omega:

  embedded transition probability matrix of dimension c(N,N) as computed
  by [`tpm_emb`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/tpm_emb.md).

- dm:

  state dwell-time distributions arranged in a list of length(N). Each
  list element needs to be a vector of length N_i, where N_i is the
  state aggregate size.

- Fm:

  optional list of length N containing the cumulative distribution
  functions of the dwell-time distributions.

- sparse:

  logical, indicating whether the output should be a **sparse** matrix.
  Defaults to `TRUE`.

- eps:

  rounding value: If an entry of the transition probabily matrix is
  smaller, than it is rounded to zero. Usually, this should not be
  changed.

## Value

extended-state-space transition probability matrix of the approximating
HMM

## Examples

``` r
# building the t.p.m. of the embedded Markov chain
omega = matrix(c(0,1,1,0), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
# defining state aggregate sizes
sizes = c(20, 30)
# defining state dwell-time distributions
lambda = c(5, 11)
dm = list(dpois(1:sizes[1]-1, lambda[1]), dpois(1:sizes[2]-1, lambda[2]))
# calculating extended-state-space t.p.m.
Gamma = tpm_hsmm(omega, dm)
```
