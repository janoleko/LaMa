Description: 
  This package provides convenient R wrapper functions for the forward algorithm that is used to fit hidden Markov models (HMMs), 
  hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs), state space models (SSMs) and point process models via direct numerical maximum likelihood estimation. 
  The algorithm calculates the log-likelihood recursively as a matrix product and uses a scaling strategy to avoid numerical underflow.
  Implementation in C++ offers 10-20 times faster evaluation times, thus substantially speeding up estimation by numerical optimizers. 
  A variety of auxiliary functions that are also necessary for likelihood evaluation are additionally implemented for both efficiency and convenience.
