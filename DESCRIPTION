Description: 
  This package provides convenient R wrapper functions for the forward algorithm used to fit hidden Markov models (HMMs), 
  hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) and state space models (SSMs) via direct numerical maximum likelihood estimation. 
  The algorithm calculates the log-likelihood recursively as a matrix product and uses a scaling strategy to avoid numerical underflow.
  Implementation in C++ offers 10-20 times faster evaluation times, thus substantially speeding up estimation by numerical optimizers.
