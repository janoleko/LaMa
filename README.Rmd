# {Lcpp}: Forward algorithm in C++ <img src="man/figures/Lcpp_logo_new.png" align="right" height=170>

A plethora of latent Markov models, including **hidden Markov models** (HMMs), **hidden semi-Markov models** (HSMMs), **state space models** (SSMs) as well as **continuous-time HMMs**, **continuous-time SSMs**, **Markov-modulated (marked) Poisson processes** (MMMPPs) and **Cox processes** can be formulated and estimated within the same framework via directly maximizing the (approximate) likelihood. The log-likelihood can be calcuated recursively as a matrix product by the so-called **forward algorithm** (for details see
<a href="https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/020_install.html" target="_blank">Zucchini et al. 2016</a>).
Implementation of the algorithm in **C++** offers 10-20 times faster evaluation times, thus substantially speeding up estimation by numerical optimizers like `nlm()` or `optim()`. This **R** package provides a toolbox for flexible and convenient model building and fast likelihood evaluation. Current implemenations of the forward algorithm are:

* `forward()` for models with **homogeneous** transition probabilities,
* `forward_g()` for general (pre-calculated) **inhomogeneous** transition probabilities (including **continuous-time** HMMs),
* `forward_p()` which is more efficient than the general implementation, when transition probabilities only vary **periodically**, and
* `forward_s()` for fitting **HSMMs**.

The functions are built to be included in the **negative log-likelihood function**, after parameters have been transformed and the *allprobs* matrix (containing all state-dependent probabilities) has been calculated. 

To serve as a toolbox, this package also includes many auxiliary functions like

* The `tpm` family with
  + `tpm()` for calculating a homogeneous transition probability matrix via the multinomial logistic link, 
  + `tpm_g()` for calculating general inhomogeneous transition probabilty matrices, 
  + `tpm_p()` for calculating transition matrices of periodically inhomogeneous HMMs,
  + `tpm_cont()` for calculating the transition probabilites of a continuous-time     Markov chain,
  + `tpm_hsmm()` for calculating the transition matrix of an HSMM-approximating HMM, and
  + `tpm_phsmm()` for calculating transition matrices of a             periodic-HSMM-approximating HMM.

* The `stationary()` family to compute stationary and periodically stationary distributions.

* `trigBasisExp()` for efficient computation of a trigonometric basis expansion.

Further functionalities will be added as needed. Have fun!

## Package documentation

Package functionalities for many different model classes are described in several vignettes:

* [Inhomogeneous HMMs](https://github.com/janoleko/Lcpp/tree/main/vignettes/Inhomogeneous_HMM.pdf)
* [Periodic HMMs](https://github.com/janoleko/Lcpp/tree/main/vignettes/Periodic_HMM.pdf)
* [State space models](https://github.com/janoleko/Lcpp/tree/main/vignettes/State_space_models.pdf)

## Installation

To install and use the package, you need to have a functional C++ compiler. For details click
<a href="https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/020_install.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Then you can use:
```{r installation, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("janoleko/Lcpp", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Feel free to use
```{r vignettes, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
browseVignettes("Lcpp")
```
or
```{r help, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
help(package = "Lcpp")
```

for detailed examples on how to use the package.

## Example: Homogeneous HMM

#### Loading the package
```{r package}
library(Lcpp)
```


#### Generating data from a 2-state HMM
Here we can use `stationary()` to compute the stationary distribution.
```{r data}
# parameters
mu = c(0, 6)
sigma = c(2, 4)
Gamma = matrix(c(0.95, 0.05, 0.15, 0.85), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
delta = stationary(Gamma) # stationary HMM

# simulation
n = 10000 # rather large
set.seed(123)
s = x = rep(NA, n)
s[1] = sample(1:2, 1, prob = delta)
x[1] = stats::rnorm(1, mu[s[1]], sigma[s[1]])
for(t in 2:n){
  s[t] = sample(1:2, 1, prob = Gamma[s[t-1],])
  x[t] = stats::rnorm(1, mu[s[t]], sigma[s[t]])
}

plot(x[1:200], bty = "n", pch = 20, ylab = "x", 
     col = c("orange","deepskyblue")[s[1:200]])
```

#### Writing the negative log-likelihood function
Here, we build the transition probability matrix using the `tpm()` function, compute the stationary distribution using `stationary()` and calculate the log-likelihood using `forward()` in the last line.
```{r mllk}
mllk = function(theta.star, x){
  # parameter transformations for unconstraint optimization
  Gamma = tpm(theta.star[1:2])
  delta = stationary(Gamma) # stationary HMM
  mu = theta.star[3:4]
  sigma = exp(theta.star[5:6])
  # calculate all state-dependent probabilities
  allprobs = matrix(1, length(x), 2)
  for(j in 1:2){ allprobs[,j] = stats::dnorm(x, mu[j], sigma[j]) }
  # return negative for minimization
  -forward(delta, Gamma, allprobs)
}
```

#### Fitting an HMM to the data
```{r model, warning=FALSE}
theta.star = c(-1,-1,1,4,log(1),log(3)) 
# initial transformed parameters: not chosen too well
s = Sys.time()
mod = stats::nlm(mllk, theta.star, x = x)
Sys.time()-s
```
Really fast for 10.000 data points!

#### Visualizing results
Again, we use `tpm()` and `stationary()` to tranform the unconstraint parameters to working parameters.
```{r visualization}
# transform parameters to working
Gamma = tpm(mod$estimate[1:2])
delta = stationary(Gamma) # stationary HMM
mu = mod$estimate[3:4]
sigma = exp(mod$estimate[5:6])

hist(x, prob = TRUE, bor = "white", breaks = 40, main = "")
curve(delta[1]*dnorm(x, mu[1], sigma[1]), add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "orange", n=500)
curve(delta[2]*dnorm(x, mu[2], sigma[2]), add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "deepskyblue", n=500)
curve(delta[1]*dnorm(x, mu[1], sigma[1])+delta[2]*dnorm(x, mu[2], sigma[2]),
      add = TRUE, lwd = 2, lty = "dashed", n=500)
legend("topright", col = c("orange", "deepskyblue", "black"), lwd = 2, bty = "n",
       lty = c(1,1,2), legend = c("state 1", "state 2", "marginal"))
```
