So-called hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) are a flexible
generalisation of HMMs to a semi-Markovian state process which is
motivated by the fact that for homogeneous HMMs, the time spent in a
hidden state, also called the state dwell time or sojourn time is
necessarily geometrically distributed as a consequence of the Markov
assumption. HSMMs are designed to mitigate this often unrealistic
assumption by allowing for arbitrary distributions on the positive
integers to be estimated for the state dwell time. Inference in such
models becomes more involved, but Langrock and Zucchini
([2011](#ref-langrock2011hidden)) showed that HSMMs can be estimated
conveniently via approximating them by HMMs with an extended state
space. Each state of the HSMMs is represented by a state aggregate of
several states and the transition probabilities within each aggregate
are designed carefully to represent the chosen dwell-time distribution.
For more details see Langrock and Zucchini
([2011](#ref-langrock2011hidden)) or Zucchini, MacDonald, and Langrock
([2016](#ref-zucchini)). Due to this approximate inference procedure,
such models can again be fitted by numerically maximising the
(approximate) likelihood which can be evaluated using the forward
algorithm.

## Simulation example

We begin by considering homogeneous HSMMs. In such models, each state
has an associated state dwell-time distribution. The transition
probability matrix of a regular HMM is replaced by these distributions
and the conditional transition probabilities given the state is left.

### Setting parameters

Here we choose the simplest case of dwell times that are **shifted
Poisson** distributed. We have to specify the Poisson mean for each
state, the conditional transition probability matrix called \Omega and
the parameters of the state-dependent process.

``` r
# loading the package
library(LaMa)
#> Loading required package: RTMB
```

``` r
lambda = c(7, 4, 4)
omega = matrix(c(0, 0.7, 0.3,
                 0.5, 0, 0.5,
                 0.7, 0.3, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
mu = c(10, 40, 100)
sigma = c(5, 20, 50)

color = c("orange", "deepskyblue", "seagreen2")
curve(dnorm(x, mu[1], sigma[1]), lwd = 2, col = color[1], bty = "n",
      xlab = "x", ylab = "density", xlim = c(0, 150), n = 300)
curve(dnorm(x, mu[2], sigma[2]), lwd = 2, col = color[2], add = T)
curve(dnorm(x, mu[3], sigma[3]), lwd = 2, col = color[3], add = T)
```

### Simulating data

We simulate data by drawing dwell times from the dwell-time distribution
of the current state and then draw the next state using the conditional
transition probabilities. The state-dependent process is drawn
conditional on the current state.

``` r
set.seed(123)

k = 50 # number of stays
s = rep(NA, k)
s[1] = sample(1:3, 1) # uniform initial distribution
staylength = rpois(1, lambda[s[1]]) + 1 # drawing dwell time from shifted Poisson
C = rep(s[1], staylength)
x = rnorm(staylength, mu[s[1]], sigma[s[1]])

for(t in 2:k){
  # conditionally drawing state
  s[t] = sample(c(1:3)[-s[t-1]], 1, prob = omega[s[t-1], -s[t-1]])
  staylength = rpois(1, lambda[s[t]]) + 1 # drawing dwell time from shifted Poisson
  
  C = c(C, rep(s[t], staylength))
  x = c(x, rnorm(staylength, mu[s[t]], sigma[s[t]]))
}

plot(x, pch = 20, col = color[C], bty = "n")
legend("topright", col = color, pch = 20, 
       legend = paste("state", 1:3), box.lwd = 0)
```

### Writing the negative log-likelihood function

We now write the negative log-likelihood function for an approximating
HMM. As a semi-Markov chain is specified in terms of state-specific
dwell-time distributions and conditional transition probabilities given
that the current state is left, we have to compute both (here called
`dm` and `omega`). For the latter, we can use the function
[`tpm_emb()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/tpm_emb.md) that
constructs a transition probability matrix via the inverse multinomial
logit link (softmax), where the diagonal entries are forced to equal
zero.

The transition probability matrix of the approxmiating HMM can then be
computed by the function
[`tpm_hsmm()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/tpm_hsmm.md) where
the exact procedure is detailed by Langrock and Zucchini
([2011](#ref-langrock2011hidden)). We need the extra argument `agsizes`
to specify the aggregate sizes that should be used to approximate the
dwell-time distributions. These should be chosen such that most of the
support of the state-specific dwell-time distributions is covered.

``` r
nll = function(par, x, N, agsizes){
  mu = par[1:N]
  sigma = exp(par[N+1:N])
  lambda = exp(par[2*N+1:N])
  omega = if(N==2) tpm_emb() else tpm_emb(par[3*N+1:(N*(N-2))])
  dm = list() # list of dwell-time distributions
  for(j in 1:N) dm[[j]] = dpois(1:agsizes[j]-1, lambda[j]) # shifted Poisson
  Gamma = tpm_hsmm(omega, dm, sparse = FALSE)
  delta = stationary(Gamma)
  allprobs = matrix(1, length(x), N)
  ind = which(!is.na(x))
  for(j in 1:N){
    allprobs[ind,j] = dnorm(x[ind], mu[j], sigma[j])
  }
  -forward_s(delta, Gamma, allprobs, agsizes)
}
```

### Fitting an HSMM (as an approxiating HMM) to the data

``` r
# intial values
par = c(10, 40, 100, log(c(5, 20, 50)), # state-dependent
               log(c(7,4,4)), # dwell time means
               rep(0, 3)) # omega

agsizes = qpois(0.95, lambda)+1

system.time(
  mod <- nlm(nll, par, x = x, N = 3, agsizes = agsizes, stepmax = 2)
)
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.858   0.030   0.888
```

Fitting HSMMs is rather slow (even using C++) as we translate the
additional model complexity into a higher computational overhead (31
states here).

## Real-data application

We now want to briefly show the analysis of a real data set using hidden
semi-Markov models. For this purpose we use the movement track of an
Arctic muskox contained in the `R` package `PHSMM`. Originally these
data where collected by Beumer et al.
([2020](#ref-beumer2020application)) and have already been analysed by
Pohle, Adam, and Beumer ([2022](#ref-pohle2022flexible)).

``` r
library(PHSMM)
data = muskox[1:1000, ] # only using first 1000 observations for speed
head(data)
#>                      date tday        x       y       step
#> 88273 2013-10-11 22:00:00   15 513299.2 8264867  17.998874
#> 88274 2013-10-11 22:00:00   16 513283.4 8264875   8.214733
#> 88275 2013-10-11 22:00:00   17 513284.3 8264883   7.205098
#> 88276 2013-10-11 22:00:00   18 513280.4 8264877  53.378332
#> 88277 2013-10-11 22:00:00   19 513252.0 8264922 719.242687
#> 88278 2013-10-11 22:00:00   20 513386.7 8265629  10.797127
```

As these data have already been preprossed, we can immediately write the
negative log-likelihood function. When modeling the dwell-time
distribution of real processes, it is typically advisable to use a more
flexible distribution than the shifted Poisson distribution, as the
latter cannot account for overdispersion. Here, we will employ the
shifted negative binomial distribution that yields the Poisson
distribution as a special case for the dispersion parameter equal to
zero. The state-dependent step lengths are modelled by gamma
distributions, where we reparametrise the gamma distribution in terms of
its mean and standard deviation as opposed to shape and scale for better
interpretability using
[`dgamma2()`](https://janoleko.github.io/reference/gamma2.md).

``` r
nll_muskox = function(par, step, N, agsizes){
  # parameter transformation from working to natural
  mu = exp(par[1:N]) # step mean
  sigma = exp(par[N+1:N]) # step standard deviation
  mu_dwell = exp(par[2*N+1:N]) # dwell time mean
  phi = exp(par[3*N+1:N]) # dwell time dispersion
  omega = if(N==2) tpm_emb() else tpm_emb(par[4*N+1:(N*(N-2))])
  dm = list() # list of dwell-time distributions
  for(j in 1:N){ 
    dm[[j]] = dnbinom(1:agsizes[j]-1, mu=mu_dwell[j], size=1/phi[j]) 
  }
  Gamma = tpm_hsmm(omega, dm, sparse = FALSE)
  delta = stationary(Gamma)
  allprobs = matrix(1, length(step), N)
  ind = which(!is.na(step))
  for(j in 1:N) allprobs[ind,j] = dgamma2(step[ind], mu[j], sigma[j])
  -forward_s(delta, Gamma, allprobs, agsizes)
}
```

### Fitting an HSMM (as an approxiating HMM) to the muskox data

``` r
# intial values
par = c(log(c(4, 50, 300, 4, 50, 300)), # state-dependent mean and sd
               log(c(3,3,5)), # dwell time means
               log(c(0.01, 0.01, 0.01)), # dwell time dispersion
               rep(0, 3)) # omega

agsizes = c(11,11,14)

system.time(
  mod_muskox <- nlm(nll_muskox, par, step = data$step, N = 3,
                    agsizes = agsizes, iterlim = 500)
)
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   3.671   0.010   3.682
```

### Results

We retransform the parameters for interpretation

``` r
par = mod_muskox$estimate; N = 3
(mu = exp(par[1:N])) # step mean
#> [1]   4.408109  55.515914 306.505074
(sigma = exp(par[N+1:N])) # step standard deviation
#> [1]   3.148127  50.337537 331.539241
(mu_dwell = exp(par[2*N+1:N])) # dwell time mean
#> [1] 2.544976 2.660328 5.541739
(phi = exp(par[3*N+1:N])) # dwell time dispersion
#> [1] 4.250213e-05 3.750903e-02 2.720856e-09
(omega = tpm_emb(par[4*N+1:(N*(N-2))])) # embedded t.p.m.
#>           S1        S2           S3
#> S1 0.0000000 0.6865909 3.134091e-01
#> S2 1.0000000 0.0000000 3.792589e-08
#> S3 0.8210713 0.1789287 0.000000e+00
```

In this case the Poisson distribution would have been sufficiently
flexible as all dispersion parameters were estimated very close to zero.
We can easily visualise the estimated state-specific dwell-time
distributions:

``` r
oldpar = par(mfrow = c(1,3))
for(j in 1:N){
  plot(1:agsizes[j], dnbinom(1:agsizes[j]-1, mu=mu_dwell[j], size = 1/phi[j]),
       type = "h", lwd = 2, col = color[j], xlab = "dwell time (hours)",
       ylab = "probabilities", main = paste("state",j), bty = "n", ylim = c(0,0.25))
}
```

```
