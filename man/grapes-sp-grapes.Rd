\title{Sparsity-retaining matrix multiplication}
\usage{
A \%sp\% B
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{matrix of dimension n x p}

\item{B}{matrix of dimension p x m}
}
\value{
the matrix product of A and B, which is of dimension n x m
}
\description{
Currently, standard matrix multiplication destroys automatic sparsity detection by \code{RTMB} which is essential for models with high-dimensional random effects.
This version retains said sparsity. It may be slightly slower when constructing the AD tape.
}
\examples{
A <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
B <- matrix(7:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
A \%sp\% B
}
