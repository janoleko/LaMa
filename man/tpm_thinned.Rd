\title{Compute the transition probability matrix of a thinned periodically inhomogeneous Markov chain.}
\usage{
tpm_thinned(Gamma, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{Gamma}{array of transition probability matrices of dimension c(N,N,L).}

\item{t}{integer index of the time point in the cycle, for which to calculate the thinned transition probility matrix}
}
\value{
thinned transition probabilty matrix of dimension c(N,N)
}
\description{
If the transition probability matrix of an inhomogeneous Markov chain varies only periodically (with period length \eqn{L}), it converges to a so-called periodically stationary distribution. 
This happens, because the thinned Markov chain, which has a full cycle as each time step, has homogeneous transition probability matrix
\deqn{\Gamma_t = \Gamma^{(t)} \Gamma^{(t+1)} \dots \Gamma^{(t+L-1)}} for all \eqn{t = 1, \dots, L.}
This function calculates the matrix above efficiently as a preliminery step to calculating the periodically stationary distribution.

\examples{
# setting parameters for trigonometric link
beta = matrix(c(-1, -2, 2, -1, 2, -4), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
# calculating periodically varying t.p.m. array (of length 24 here)
Gamma = tpm_p(beta = beta)
# calculating t.p.m. of thinned Markov chain
tpm_thinned(Gamma, 4)
