# Loch Ness Monster Acceleration Data

A small group of researchers managed to put an accelerometer on the Loch
Ness Monster and collected data for a few days. Now we have a data set
of the overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) of the creature.

## Usage

``` r
nessi
```

## Format

A data frame with 5.000 rows and 3 variables:

- ODBA:

  overall dynamci body acceleration

- logODBA:

  logarithm of overall dynamic body acceleration

- state:

  hidden state variable

## Source

Generated for example purposes.
