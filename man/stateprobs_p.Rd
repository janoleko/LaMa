\title{Calculate conditional local state probabilities for periodically inhomogeneous HMMs}
\usage{
stateprobs_p(delta, Gamma, allprobs, tod, trackID = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{initial or stationary distribution of length N, or matrix of dimension c(k,N) for k independent tracks, if \code{trackID} is provided

This could e.g. be the periodically stationary distribution (for each track) as computed by \code{\link{stationary_p}}.}

\item{Gamma}{array of transition probability matrices for each time point in the cycle of dimension c(N,N,L), where L is the length of the cycle.}

\item{allprobs}{matrix of state-dependent probabilities/ density values of dimension c(n, N)}

\item{tod}{(Integer valued) variable for cycle indexing in 1, ..., L, mapping the data index to a generalised time of day (length n).
For half-hourly data L = 48. It could, however, also be day of year for daily data and L = 365.}

\item{trackID}{optional vector of k track IDs, if multiple tracks need to be decoded separately}
}
\value{
matrix of conditional state probabilities of dimension c(n,N)
}
