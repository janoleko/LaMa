\title{Build the design and penalty matrices for smooth density estimation}
\usage{
buildSmoothDens(data, type = "real", par, k = 20, degree = 3, diff_order = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{named data frame of different data streams}

\item{type}{type of each data stream, either \code{"real"} for data on the reals, \code{"positive"} for data on the positive reals or \code{"circular"} for angular data. Needs to be a vector corresponding to the number of data streams in \code{data}.}

\item{par}{nested named list of initial means and sds/concentrations for each data stream}

\item{k}{number of basis functions for each data stream}

\item{degree}{degree of the B-spline basis functions for each data stream, defaults to cubic B-splines}

\item{diff_order}{order of differencing used for the P-Spline penalty matrix for each data stream. Defaults to second-order differences.}
}
\value{
a nested list containing the design matrices \code{Z}, the penalty matrices \code{S}, the initial coefficients \code{coef} the prediction design matrices \code{Z_predict}, the prediction grids \code{xseq}, and details for the basis expansion for each data stream.
}
\description{
This high-level function can be used to prepare objects needed to estimate mixture models of smooth densities using P-Splines.
}
\details{
Under the hood, \code{\link{make_matrices_dens}} is used for the actual construction of the design and penalty matrices.

You can provide one or multiple data streams of different types (real, positive, circular) and specify initial means and standard deviations/ concentrations for each data stream. This information is then converted into suitable spline coefficients.
\code{buildSmoothDens} then constructs the design and penalty matrices for standardised B-splines basis functions (integrating to one) for each data stream.
For types \code{"real"} and \code{"circular"} the knots are placed equidistant in the range of the data, for type \code{"positive"} the knots are placed using polynomial spacing.

\examples{
## 3 data streams, each with one distribution
# normal data with mean 0 and sd 1
x1 = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
# gamma data with mean 5 and sd 3
x2 = rgamma2(100, mu = 5, sigma = 3)
# circular data
x3 = rvm(100, mu = 0, kappa = 2)

data = data.frame(x1 = x1, x2 = x2, x3 = x3)

par = list(x1 = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),
           x2 = list(mean = 5, sd = 3),
           x3 = list(mean = 0, concentration = 2))

SmoothDens = buildSmoothDens(data, 
                             type = c("real", "positive", "circular"),
                             par)
                             
# extracting objects for x1
Z1 = SmoothDens$Z$x1
S1 = SmoothDens$S$x1
coefs1 = SmoothDens$coef$x1

## one data stream, but mixture of two distributions
# normal data with mean 0 and sd 1
x = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
data = data.frame(x = x)

# now parameters for mixture of two normals
par = list(x = list(mean = c(0, 5), sd = c(1,1)))

SmoothDens = buildSmoothDens(data, par = par)

# extracting objects 
Z = SmoothDens$Z$x
S = SmoothDens$S$x
coefs = SmoothDens$coef$x
